Those colors fade to shades of grey,
Since I saw them that Saturday.
The flowers you brought now wilt and die,
Like promises broken, I don't ask why.

You made me special, brought gifts and light,
Then left me stranded in endless night.
I gave you one thing - my honest love,
While you played games I knew nothing of.

Why build these castles in my mind,
If you planned to leave me far behind?
The story ends, not as we plannedâ€”
Another holds your precious hand.

My favorite moments? Now touched with pain,
Like photographs warped by autumn rain.
I loved her true - that's all I did,
While she kept her real heart safely hid.

But perhaps someday I'll understand
Why fate wrote this with such cruel hand.
For now I'll hold these lessons tight:
Not all who shine bring lasting light.
