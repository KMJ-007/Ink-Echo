My favorite color? It changes with light,
Like the way my heart skips when you come into sight.
The ocean's deep blue has nothing on your eyes,
And yes, I'd reach for your hand—what a sweet surprise.

My coffee's bitter-sweet, like this game we play,
But Sundays are special—they stretch time away.
Hide and seek? I'm already lost in your gaze,
Finding pieces of you through these poetic days.

The perfect date? Just walking beneath stars,
Trading stories and dreams, no need for fancy cars.
Fate? Well, meeting you made me wonder more
About all those chances I didn't believe in before.

My song's unfinished, waiting for your voice to blend,
And my favorite book's the story we've yet to pen.
Morning or midnight—any time you're near
Becomes the moment I hold most dear.

As for wine or beer? I'll share whatever you choose,
In this dance of questions, there's nothing to lose.
Soulmates and subscriptions? Here's what I think:
Some connections just flow, like words and ink.

My favorite holiday? The day you smiled my way,
And every moment since that makes me want to stay.
So ask me my favorites, I'll give you the truth:
They're all tied to moments I've shared here with you.

You asked about colors, about seasons and time,
I'm giving you answers wrapped up in this rhyme.
But here's what I really want you to know:
It's not what I like, but how you make me glow.
