It's not about place, they say,
It's about the person.

I whisper back,
It's not about the person,
But about the feelings that burn.

They claim:
Girl and boy can't be friends,
A line drawn in social sand.

I ponder my hedgehog dilemmaâ€”
Longing for warmth, yet fearing the barbs of connection,
Close enough to touch, too sharp to embrace.

How near can we come
Without drawing blood?

How far can we drift
Without losing what might be love?

Maybe I lose you if i say i love you,
but it's fear that i hear?
