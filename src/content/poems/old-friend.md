How it's like you want to share!
but don't want to feel the pity,

don't want special attention from anybody,
but life throws and removes spotlights,

sometimes you feel main character and sometime nothing,
but when you always that missing void,

too fragile to speak, and too fragile to remember,
but you keep thinking will i judge myself for judging

don't know how much sorrow i can take,
but sorrow is what keeps me going

is it the inner me wanting to not want something,
but want to revert that one moment of the life.
