How it's like you want to share!
but don't want their pity to bear,

don't want special attention from any face,
but life throws spotlights then leaves no trace,

sometimes you feel main character and sometime none,
but when you face that void, you want to run,

too fragile to speak, and fragile to recall,
but you keep thinking if judgment should fall,

don't know how much sorrow I can take,
but sorrow is what keeps me awake,

is it the inner me wanting to not want more,
but wish to revert that moment from before.
