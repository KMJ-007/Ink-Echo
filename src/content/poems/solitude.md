title: "Solitude"
date: "12th Dec 24"

i feel like nothing,
something feels nothing,
my inner K wants jumping,
but is it worth it?
i don't even know,
it's like answer asking question,
solitude, solitude, solitude,
why are you like this?
sometimes i want to hug you like you are blessing,
sometimes i hate you like everything,
the answers i seek from the world,
are the answer i really want?
why one need answers?
just to make them look smarty?
but inner answers are where i find zero dimension,
i want to hug and never leave you,
you don't hurt me, but you make me lonely,
why keep running?
just sit and enjoy the beauty of loving,
love feels shallow in the shallow world,
which takes me back to you,
you are the one constant!
